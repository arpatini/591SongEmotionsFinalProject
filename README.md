# 591SongEmotionsFinalProject

When you first run the Design.java, a window will open that has two search bars at the top, labeled Song and Artist. 
There will be a large dark gray rectangular area below and a button labeled: "What emotion will I feel when I listen to 
this song?" right above a text area.

You begin by typing in either the song search bar or artist search bar. As you type, suggestions will appear below in the 
dark gray area. If you see the song you are looking for, you can click on the suggestion and the song and artist will be 
automatically input to the two search bars. If you don't see the option as you type, you can keep typing until you see the
option or have written out the entire song and artist name. 

After you have the song and artist name written out in the search bars, you can now click the button above the text area at 
the bottom of the screen. If the song is not recognized or you left one of the search bars empty, the text area will say: 
"We do not have data on this song, sorry :)" Otherwise, the text area will say: The main emotion elicited from 
[the chosen song] by [the artist] is [an emotion]! An example would be if you type "I Choose You" into the song search
bar and "Sara Bareilles" into the artist search bar and then click the button. The text area would then say: "The main 
emotion elicited from I Choose You by Sara Bareilles is "trust"!

You can then delete the text from the search bars and try again if you would like to.
